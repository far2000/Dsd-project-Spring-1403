# Calculator

this project has 4 instruction, load from memory, save in memory, addition and multiplication



## Results
 here is the test bench results:

In The final test bench, some random data is first loaded into memory upon initiation. This data is then loaded into registers A1 and A2. On the next instruction, the result of adding these two registers is stored into A3 and A4 and then the value for A3 is saved to some address in memory and then loaded into A1. A1 and A2 are then multiplied and the lower 512 bits is store in the same memory address as before and then loaded again into A4.
